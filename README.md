## A trip down internship-lane.

**_The full documentation of my 10 weeks at [Lucas &amp; Mallee](http://www.lucasenmallee.nl/) as an Front-end Developer._**

During this period I wrote many lines of code, drank ~~a lot of~~ beer and offcourse; learned many things*

###*These kind of things:

+ Gulp.js build system
+ Cloud9 development tool
+ SCSS and Sass preprocessing languages
+ LESS HTML
+ Complicated CSS3 Animations
+ BEM and SMACCS Syntax
+ The office manager Balthy barks to everything with four legs, hair and tail.
+ Working with GIT(hub)
+[Fastshell](http://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell)
+ Advanced jQuery and Javascript
+ The Red Light District is a place full of high and drunk tourists, but I love it


Run index.html to see my documentation (instead of the old paper one) and enjoy!
